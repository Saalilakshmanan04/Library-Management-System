# 📚 Library Management System (Core Java, Console-Based)

## 📌 Introduction
The **Library Management System** is a simple console-based application built using **Core Java**.  
It allows users to **add, view, search, and delete books** from a collection using a **menu-driven interface**.  

This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and the **Java Collection Framework** to manage data dynamically.

## ✨ Features
1. ➕ **Add New Books**  
2. 📖 **Display All Books**  
3. 🔍 **Search for a Book by Title**  
4. ❌ **Remove a Book by ID**  
5. 🚪 **Exit the Application**

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- **Classes & Objects** – Book, LibraryManagementSystem  
- **Encapsulation** – Private fields with public getters/setters  
- **ArrayList (Collection Framework)** – For dynamic book storage  
- **Loops & Conditionals** – For program control flow  
- **Switch Case** – Menu-driven navigation  
- **Scanner** – For user input handling  
- **Lambda Expression** – Used with `removeIf()` to delete books by ID  
- **Method Overriding** – Overridden `toString()` method for displaying book details

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Applying **Core Java OOP concepts** in a real project  
- Using **ArrayList** to store and manage dynamic collections  
- Implementing **menu-driven programs** with loops & conditionals  
- Handling user input with **Scanner class**  
- Using **lambda expressions** for efficient data operations  
- Improving understanding of **encapsulation and clean code practices**

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add **file storage or database integration** for persistent data  
- Implement **exception handling** for robust input validation  
- Add features like **update book details** and **borrow/return system**
